pycaputo
========

This library can be used to evaluate fractional integrals and solve fractional ODEs.
It is currently a testbed for various traditional methods, but hopefully
development will continue and it will be a nice flexible library with support
for many different types of fractional derivatives (and other related operators).

It is currently quite far from that goal, so this is **very experimental**.
