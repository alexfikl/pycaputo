    Table 1 from [Lubich1986]_ gives the generating functions. The weights

    larger orders are not stable.

    :arg n: number of weights.

    r"""Constructs starting weights for a given set of weights *w* from [Lubich1986]_.

    The starting weights are introduced to handle a lack of smoothness of the
    functions being integrated. They are constructed in such a way that they
    are exact for a series of monomials, which results in an accurate
    quadrature for functions of the form :math:`f(x) = x^{\beta - 1} g(x)`,
    where :math:`g` is smooth.

    Therefore, they are obtained by solving

    .. math::

        \sum_{k = 0}^s w_{mk} k^{q + \beta - 1} =
        \frac{\Gamma(q + \beta)}{\Gamma(q + \beta + \alpha)}
        m^{q + \beta + \alpha - 1} -
        \sum_{k = 0}^s w_{n - k} j^{q + \beta - 1}

    where :math:`q \in \{0, 1, \dots, s - 1\}` and :math:`\beta \ne \{0, -1, \dots\}`.
    In the simplest case, we can take :math:`\beta = 1` and obtain integer
    powers. Other values can be chosen depending on the behaviour of :math:`f(x)`
    near the origin.

    Note that the starting weights are only computed for :math:`m \ge s`.
    The initial :math:`s` steps are expected to be computed in some other
    fashion.

    :arg w: convolution weights defined by [Lubich1986]_.
    :arg s: number of starting weights.
    :arg alpha: order of the fractional derivative to approximate.
    :arg beta: order of the singularity at the origin.
    :arg atol: absolute tolerance used for the GMRES solver. If *None*, an
        exact LU-based solver is used instead.

    :returns: the starting weights for every point :math:`x_m` starting with
